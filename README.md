# leetcode

**LeetCode solutions in java**(From Easy to Hard). Welcome to fork and comments.

During the test, I summarized the commonly used algorithm as [modelUtil repository](https://github.com/zhangCabbage/modelUtil).
the `modelUtil` contains common algorithm of `sort`、`search`、`tree`,
common use of `string`、`array`、`list`,
common algorithom design method of `dynamic programming`、`search strategy`,
and some method of `number theory`、`bit manipultion`.
Maybe Some modules may not be very perfect, I will continue to improve it.

## Illustrate

`16.10.28` **Said:**
> From `April 3rd` to `October 28th` almost six and a half months, I completed half of the leetcode problem, all of the easy and almost all of the medium problem.
Basically every question, hold on for half a year, except during the national day of half a month of desertion. The next plan is to finish the rest of the 42 medium problem, and then began to sum up and review.
