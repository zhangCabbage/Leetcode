**LeetCode solutions in java**(From Easy to Hard). Welcome to fork and comments.

During the test, I summarized the commonly used algorithm as [modelUtil repository](https://github.com/zhangCabbage/modelUtil).
the `modelUtil` contains common algorithm of `sort`、`search`、`tree`,
common use of `string`、`array`、`list`,
common algorithom design method of `dynamic programming`、`search strategy`,
and some method of `number theory`、`bit manipultion`.
Maybe Some modules may not be very perfect, I will continue to improve it.
